Activity: Put together a ROAM analysis

Question 1
To pass this practice quiz, you must receive at least 80%, or 4 out of 5 points, by completing the activity and answering corresponding quiz questions. You can learn more about the graded and practice items in the Course Overview.

Activity Overview
In this activity, you will apply risk management skills to identify risks and put together a ROAM analysis. You can use a ROAM analysis to analyze, prioritize, and manage risks that have already become issues. It's a great tool to keep teams organized, so they know what needs to be done to keep the project moving forward.

In a ROAM analysis, you identify project issues and put them into one of the following four categories:

Resolved: The issue has been eliminated and no longer poses a problem.

Owned: The issue has been assigned to a team member who will monitor it through to completion.

Accepted: The issue is minor or cannot be resolved, so the team chooses to accept and work around it.

Mitigated: The team has taken action to reduce the impact of the issue (or reduce the likelihood of a risk that has not yet materialized).

Be sure to complete this activity before moving on. The next course item will provide you with a completed exemplar to compare to your own work. You will not be able to access the exemplar until you have completed this activity. 

Scenario

Review the scenario below. Then complete the step-by-step instructions.

After installing the new software to keep track of orders and shipments, Plant Pals began sending out the first test batch of plants to customers. Your team has been conducting an ongoing customer satisfaction survey. Two weeks into the test shipments, the survey reveals the following issues:

The warehouse team reports that 10% of the plants were not properly potted. This leads to customer complaints, profit loss, and budget issues you did not anticipate. 

Due to a software issue, the customer relations team is receiving only 30% of requests and complaints. This leads to customer dissatisfaction.

There are not enough delivery drivers to deliver all the Plant Pals orders on time. The current delivery completion rate is 80%, leading some customers to cancel their subscriptions.
