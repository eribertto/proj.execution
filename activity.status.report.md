Activity: Build and explain a project status report

Question 1
To pass this practice quiz, you must receive 100%, or 1 out of 1 point, by completing the activity below. You can learn more about the graded and practice items in the Course Overview.

Activity Overview
In this activity, you will create a status report for project tasks and milestones. Project status reports improve and simplify communication across teams and keep key stakeholders informed. They also create structure and maintain transparency by making the project status available in a central location. 

Your status report should include:

A project summary and date

Key dates

Progress towards milestones (completed and upcoming)

Issues and risks, along with their impact and any actions to be taken

Be sure to complete this activity before moving on. The next course item will provide you with a completed exemplar to compare to your own work. You will not be able to access the exemplar until you have completed this activity.

Scenario

Review the scenario below. Then complete the step-by-step instructions.

Office Green is testing the Plant Pals project before its launch and you are the project manager responsible for the trial’s smooth operation. Your goal is keeping track of completed and upcoming tasks and milestones, as well as finding solutions for any issues that arise. 

Completed Plant Pals tasks and milestones include:

The IT Specialist purchased a new software to keep track of incoming orders and installed it on June 15. The installation took three days longer than expected.

The Fulfillment Director began sending test batches of Plant Pals orders to customers on June 21. The number of orders exceeded targets by 15%.

Upcoming Plant Pals tasks and milestones include:

Send existing customers an e-newsletter with a tutorial on caring for their plants by July 7. The newsletter must follow Office Green’s brand design guidelines.  

Hit at least 95% of delivery dates on time by July 19. The error rate should be under 5%.

Your team is conducting an ongoing customer satisfaction survey for the test batches. The survey results for the first two weeks of shipments reveal three major issues: 

The warehouse team reports that 10% of the plants were not properly potted. This leads to customer complaints, profit loss, and budget issues you did not anticipate. Your Warehouse Operations Manager is responsible for taking action on this issue.

Due to an issue with the new software, the customer service team is receiving only 30% of requests and complaints. This leads to customer dissatisfaction. The team’s IT Specialist is responsible for taking action on this issue.

There are not enough delivery drivers to deliver all the Plant Pals orders on time. The current delivery completion rate is 80%, leading some customers to cancel their subscriptions. The Human Resources Specialist is responsible for taking action on this issue.

The team must address these issues in order to hit their upcoming project milestones. Your project status report will help them do that.

Step 2: Review the word bank

Review the word bank below. You will use it to complete the project status report in Steps 3-6. Note that part of the status report has already been filled in for you.

Word bank: 

Customer Service Manager

IT Specialist

Amber

Fulfillment Director

Cancelled subscriptions

June 15

July 7

The warehouse team reports that 10% of the plants were not properly potted

The current delivery completion rate is only 80%

Evaluate and adjust the plant potting process

Purchased and installed new software to keep track of incoming orders

Hit at least 95% of delivery dates on time

Step 3: Add completed tasks and milestones

Record the tasks and milestones your team has already reached under Completed Tasks and Milestones. Select descriptions of milestones, their completion dates, and owners from the word bank and add them to the spreadsheet.

Then add any missing information or resources you want to share with stakeholders under Comments. For example, the comment for the milestone “Sent first batch of Plant Pals orders to customers” is, “The number of orders exceeded targets by 15%.” 

Note: Comments are not included in the word bank. Review the scenario to determine what information could be useful to stakeholders.

Step 4: Add upcoming tasks and milestones

Under Upcoming Task and Milestones, add any missing descriptions, due dates, and task owners from the word bank. Review the scenario and add comments if need be.

Step 5: Add risks and issues

Under Top Risks and Issues, add any missing items, including issues that have arisen, their impact, any actions that should be taken, and the person responsible for fixing them.

Step 6: Add a RAG status

Under Overall Status (RAG), select a RAG status from the dropdown menu. RAG (Red, Amber, Green)—also known as stoplight status—is an acronym that indicates project status. Red means the project is off-track and needs significant changes to correct. Amber means the project is off-track and needs minor changes to correct. Green means the project is on target. Consider the information you added to the chart to determine whether the project is on target. Then select the appropriate RAG status.

Note: Best practices for selecting RAG ratings can vary by organization. For example, some tend toward higher RAG ratings, preferring them to be too high rather than too low. It’s important to understand your organization’s customs, so you and your stakeholders can stay on the same page. 

Step 7: Save your status report

Save your completed status report to your computer or Google Drive. You'll need it again later in the course.

Pro Tip: Save the template
Finally, be sure to save a blank copy of the status report template you used to complete this activity. You can use it for further practice or in your own personal or professional projects. These templates will be useful as you put together a portfolio of project management artifacts. You can use them to work through your thought processes as you demonstrate your experience to potential employers.

What to include in your response

Be sure to address the following elements in your completed project status report:

The Completed Milestones and Tasks section includes descriptions, dates, owners, and any relevant comments.

The Upcoming Milestones and Tasks section includes descriptions, dates, owners, and any relevant comments.

The Top Risks and Issues section includes any issues, their impact, actions to be taken, and the person responsible for fixing the issues.

The report includes an amber RAG status for the project.
