Assessment of Exemplar

Compare the exemplar to your completed presentation. Review your work using each of the criteria in the exemplar. What did you do well? Where can you improve? Use your answers to these questions to guide you as you continue to progress through the course. 

Note: Your presentation reflects your own creative vision, so it likely differs from the exemplar in certain ways. 

Let’s review the exemplar components:

Summary slide: The summary outlines the number of participants, the timeline, and the purpose of the survey: “We surveyed 50 Plant Pals test batch customers over a four-week period to learn about their satisfaction with the product, delivery process, and customer support.”

Data point 1: This data point uses a line graph, since the results track the number of on-time deliveries over four weeks. The delivery rate of 90% in week four is still short of the 95% target, so the action item is to investigate additional causes for late deliveries.

Data point 2: This data point uses a column chart (also called a vertical bar chart), since the results compare preferred delivery windows throughout the day. (A pie chart can also work for this data point.) The action item is to schedule more deliveries for the preferred windows.

Data point 3: This data point uses a line graph, since it tracks satisfaction with support over time. Satisfaction went up significantly after the team fixed the software issue. The action item is to monitor responses to support tickets to identify areas for further improvement.

Data point 4: This data point uses a pie chart, since it shows the percentages of total responses to the question. The action items include shifting more resources in tutorials and live chat, since a large percentage of respondents found them helpful.

Conclusion slide: The conclusion wraps up the presentation by summarizing the main points. It points out the team’s successes and gives recommendations for further improvements.
