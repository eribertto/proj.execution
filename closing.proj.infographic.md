Putting together
Compile your closeout report and add the notes from your recent retrospective. Together, these documents represent the consensus of your team regarding what went well and what needs improvement.

Make sure all stakeholders are aware that this phase is ending
Compose an email to all stakeholders to let them know you're finished with the scene. As a bonus, you can include a 30-second clip to preview the deliverable.

Refer to prior documentation
Revisit the statement of work SOW for the scene, as well as the risk register and the project plan. Check that your team completed each of their tasks, and that you delivered on all of the required work.

Conduct administrative closure of the procurement process
The scene required some specialized vendors and it's time to close out their contracts and pay them. It is also time to return props that were on loan from the a science fiction museum.

Complete any necessary follow-up work
Ensure that your team follows up on the action items that you established during your retrospective. Follow up with your outside vendors to uncover any final pieces of feedback about the project phase.
